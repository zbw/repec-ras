# ZBW's RAS-GND author ID mapping

ZBW's [EconBiz](www.econbiz.de) search portal contains metadata about publications in economics from multiple sources. Therefore, duplicates occur in the data (e.g. a publication as entered in RePEc and as entered in ZBW's catalogue). In order to detect such duplicates, a project has been launched. As a side result of this project - since in the ZBW catalogue the authors of publications are identified by their GND ID, and in RePEc by their RAS ID - mappings of authors has been derived from the matching papers. That has been done very conservatively, with a threshold of at least 10 matching papers. Additionally, in order to disambiquate co-authorship, the author names for both ids were required to be similar (Levenshtein distance < 5). That yielded 3,081 GND/RAS mappings.
