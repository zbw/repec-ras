The resuls of ras_mix_n_match.rq have been downloaded manually from Sparql Lab
as CSV file.

In ras_top.csv, 3 lines, with Russian and Chinese names, have been deleted
because of missing quotes, which resulted in loading errors in Mix'n'match.

The files have been transformed to .tsv via

  cat ras_top.csv | sed 's/^ "//'| sed 's/" , "/\t/g' | sed 's/" ,$//' > \
    ras_top.tsv
